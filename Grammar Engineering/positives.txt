Lisa plays jazz
Bart giggles
Lisa giggled
Bart wears blue shoes
Bart always drinks milk
Bart and Homer drank milk
Homer and Bart never drink milk in the kitchen after dinner
Homer serves Lisa and Bart a healthy green salad
Lisa puts the milk in the kitchen
Lisa thinks Homer thinks Bart drinks milk
when does Lisa drink milk in the kitchen
when do Lisa and Bart wear shoes
when Homer drinks milk Bart giggles
